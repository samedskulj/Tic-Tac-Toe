# Tic-Tac-Toe
Simple game of Tic Tac Toe made using only Vanilla JS, CSS and HTML

#Description
Very simple CSS and JS code for beginners.
The 'X' and 'O' marks have been made using the CSS variables, beacuse if I had inputed the 'X' from keyboard or picture of 'X' mark it would have been difficult to center them in the middle of the cells.
